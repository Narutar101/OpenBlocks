I was playing my custom modpack. It crashed. It crashed because of OpenBlocks because if I remove OpenBlocks and recreate what I did when it crashed the game doesnÂ´t crash. When  it crashed i was morphed into a zombie (Using the morph mod) and died. The game lagged the death message popped up and the game crashed.
Here is the crash log: https://pastebin.com/1NcvnQvU
